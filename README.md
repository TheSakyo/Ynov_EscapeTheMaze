## Escape The Maze an Unity Game
### My very first project, carried out on the Ynov campus

Go on an adventure in this 2D Unity mini-game, in which the player must navigate a labyrinth of enemies. Your mission is to escape the labyrinth and find your friend trapped inside. Explore different paths and avoid hostile creatures. Can you conquer the labyrinth and save your friend before the hostile creatures kill you?
